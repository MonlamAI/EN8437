An angel speaks 

With words, with colours, in silence  

they drew nigh, gave me hair and wing

locked me into human form.


And now like any mortal

with silhouette and shadow

I am inside me.


Stonemasons, painters and poets

laboured day and night

to shape me out of their dreams.


I want to escape the body's cage,

take back my original being: that

pure invisibility.
